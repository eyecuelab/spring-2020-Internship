Curo is a project management tool designed to help budding makers pivot their craft from hobby to profession. Curo offers kanban style task management, cost-tracking, and financial analysis tools that work in combination to answer the question so many creatives ask themselves - "Can I really do this?"

Curo helps makers on the cusp of entrepreneurship better understand their process, their costs, and their business model. Moreover, Curo is a powerful platform for established makers to easily organize multiple projects and to continue to optimize their process.

Curo was developed using TypeScript, React with Redux Toolkit, Node.js/Express, PostgreSQL.
